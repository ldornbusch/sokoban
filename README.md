# sokoban

sokoban client in pygame

re-created from over 30 year old Amiga Basic source code which I converted to GFABasic:
https://github.com/ldornbusch/AmigaSource/blob/master/gfabasic/PushAndMove/PUSH.GFA

The graphics were drawn with drawing commands and then blitted to the screen.
For nostalgic reasons I keep the neon-palette :)
